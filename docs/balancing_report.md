## Balancing Methodology

### Sampling Strategy
- **Target Size**: 15,000 samples per class
- **Undersampling**: Applied to classes with >15,000 samples (random sampling without replacement)
- **Oversampling**: Applied to classes with <15,000 samples (random sampling with replacement)
- **Random Seed**: 42 (for reproducibility)

### Class-Specific Actions

**requests_or_urgent_needs**  
- Method: Oversampling  
- Action: Oversampled 12,178 samples to 15,000 using random replacement  
- Change: 12,178 → 15,000 samples  

**infrastructure_and_utility_damage**  
- Method: Oversampling  
- Action: Oversampled 8,877 samples to 15,000 using random replacement  
- Change: 8,877 → 15,000 samples  

**injured_or_dead_people**  
- Method: Oversampling  
- Action: Oversampled 12,195 samples to 15,000 using random replacement  
- Change: 12,195 → 15,000 samples  

**rescue_volunteering_or_donation_effort**  
- Method: Oversampling  
- Action: Oversampled 13,004 samples to 15,000 using random replacement  
- Change: 13,004 → 15,000 samples  

**other_relevant_information**  
- Method: Undersampling  
- Action: Randomly sampled 15,000 from 189,222 available samples  
- Change: 189,222 → 15,000 samples  

**not_humanitarian**  
- Method: Undersampling  
- Action: Randomly sampled 15,000 from 142,161 available samples  
- Change: 142,161 → 15,000 samples

## Quality Assurance

### Stratification Verification
- ✅ Stratified sampling ensures proportional class distribution across splits
- ✅ Each class maintains ~16.7% representation in all splits
- ✅ Random seed (42) ensures reproducible results

### Data Integrity
- ✅ No duplicate samples across train/validation/test splits
- ✅ Original text content preserved during sampling
- ✅ Label consistency maintained
- ✅ Text quality preserved (no truncation or modification)

## Impact Assessment

### Model Training Benefits
1. **Reduced Bias**: Eliminates model preference for majority classes
2. **Improved Minority Class Performance**: Better recall for critical crisis categories
3. **Balanced Learning**: Equal learning opportunities for all crisis types
4. **Robust Evaluation**: Meaningful accuracy and F1-score metrics

### Potential Considerations
1. **Oversampling Effects**: Some minority classes have duplicated samples
2. **Dataset Size**: Reduced from original due to undersampling of majority classes
3. **Distribution Shift**: Balanced distribution may not reflect real-world frequencies

## Recommendations

### Model Training
1. Use macro F1-score as primary evaluation metric
2. Monitor per-class precision and recall
3. Consider weighted loss functions during training
4. Implement cross-validation for robust performance estimation

### Production Deployment
1. Monitor real-world class distribution vs training distribution
2. Consider ensemble methods to handle distribution shift
3. Implement confidence thresholding for uncertain predictions
4. Regular model retraining with updated data
